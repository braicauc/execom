# A "foruchat" system

What do we need for this project:
1. Laravel 5.2 - if you have Composer just run : composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel execom
   You can get Composer from here https://getcomposer.org/download/

2. Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
   2.1 GULP - after you have Node on your machine (you can verify in command line with node -v) type npm install gulp
   2.2 Elixir - npm install laravel-elixir

3. REDIS database server from: http://redis.io/topics/quickstart
   Be very carefoul with that one. It`s very vulnerable on attacks if you start the server with no config file.
   Also, in the config file put a very long password ... something like asdf0kkd_sdfasd_sadfasdfa__asdfasdfasdf___asdfasdf

To be continued ....
